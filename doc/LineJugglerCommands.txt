DESCRIPTION				     *LineJugglerCommands-description*

Most of the line manipulation mappings of the |LineJuggler.vim| plugin can
also be done with built-in Ex commands like |:move|, |:put|, etc. This plugin
adds those commands that do not exist (in a simple form) as built-in commands.
Sometimes, a command is just more practical (e.g. in a script), more
repeatable (from the command-line history), or offers different line
addressing.
Namely, this plugin provides a |:BlankLine| command, a |:Swap| command to
exchange two ranges of lines (or with a register), and a similar |:Replace|
command.

SOURCE									     *

Inspired by the following Stack Overflow question:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15296393/line-swapping-in-vim/15298132

SEE ALSO								     *

- This plugin is based on the functionality of the (required) |LineJugger.vim|
  plugin (vimscript #4140), which offers many mappings to quickly duplicate
  and move lines to above / below the current line.
- ReplaceWithRegister.vim (vimscript #2703) provides normal and visual mode
  |gr| commands that are similar to the |:Replace| Ex command.

==============================================================================
USAGE						   *LineJugglerCommands-usage*
								  *:BlankLine*
:[range]BlankLine [N]	Add [N] blank line(s) below the current line / last
			line in [range].
								       *:Swap*
:[range]Swap {range}	Exchange the current line / line(s) given by [range]
			with the lines in {range}.
:[range]Swap [["]x]	Exchange the current line / line(s) given by [range]
			with the text from register [x]. This always works
			|linewise|, like a combination of |:delete| [x] and
			|:put|.
								    *:Replace*
:[range]Replace {range}	Replace the current line / line(s) given by [range]
			with the lines in {range}.
:[range]Replace [["]x]
			Replace the current line / line(s) given by [range]
			with the text from register [x]. This always works
			|linewise|, like a combination of |:delete| and
			|:put|.

			Note: To use one of the numbered registers 1-9, you
			need to prepend the optional double quotes ("1 - "9),
			in order to disambiguate them from the absolute lines
			1 - 9.
